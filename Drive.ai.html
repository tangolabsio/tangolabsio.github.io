      <p><b>Description</b></p>
      <p>
        Drive.ai is a mobile application for the iPhone that implements a custom
        image classification algorithm to detect distracted driving and audibly
        alert drivers in real time. Drive.ai does not only detect distracted
        driving, but also provides the driver with valuable information as to
        how they were distracted, supporting 10 types of distracted driving.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><b>Front end</b></p>
      <p>
        We developed Drive.ai in Xcode using Swift. Drive.ai features a
        non-distracting screen while driving or a map with both visual and
        auditory directions. Furthermore, Drive.ai adjusts the color of its user
        interface to ensure that the phone is as least distracting as possible.
        Finally, Drive.ai includes a page that appears once the drive has
        culminated that displays valuable statistics about how the driver was
        primarily distracted to improve in the future.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p><b>Machine learning</b></p>
      <p>
        We used Tensorflow with Keras and transfer learning on VGG19 to develop
        our image classification algorithm. After training, we received 93%
        validation accuracy.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p><b>Awards</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>CodeDay</b>: The first iteration of Drive.ai was developed in 24
        hours for the CodeDay Bellevue hackathon in 2019. Drive.ai received the
        Best in Show award.
